# Knife_Catalog
A searchable database utility for my knife collection
If I wasn't a poor college student with little disposable income 
I'd get far more milage out of this little program. 

As the files and database entires are realatively small, I implement a simple vector
data scheme. 


If you have any suggestions for how to improve this project, please help me out!
